# Time series with tensorflow

Fundamentals of a Time series forecasting problem using Tensorflow.

In this repository we will be building a Bitcoin price predictor (BitPredict ðŸ’°ðŸ“ˆ) using it's historical price over the years.

## What is a time series problem ?

Time series problems deal with data over time.

Such as, the number of staff members in a company over 10-years, sales of computers for the past 5-years, electricity usage for the past 50-years.

The timeline can be short (seconds/minutes) or long (years/decades). And the problems you might investigate using can usually be broken down into two categories.

|-----|-----|-----|
| **Problem Type** | **Examples** | **Output** |
| **Classification** | Anomaly detection, time series identification (where did this time series come from?) | Discrete (a label) |
| **Forecasting** | Predicting stock market prices, forecasting future demand for a product, stocking inventory requirements | Continuous (a number) |
