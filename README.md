# Time series with tensorflow

Fundamentals of a Time series forecasting problem using Tensorflow.

In this repository we will be building a Bitcoin price predictor (BitPredict ðŸ’°ðŸ“ˆ) using it's historical price over the years.

## What is a time series problem ?

Time series problems deal with data over time.

Such as, the number of staff members in a company over 10-years, sales of computers for the past 5-years, electricity usage for the past 50-years.

The timeline can be short (seconds/minutes) or long (years/decades). And the problems you might investigate using can usually be broken down into two categories.

| **Problem Type** | **Examples** | **Output** |
|------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Classification** | Anomaly detection, time series identification (where did this time series come from?) | Discrete (a label) |
| **Forecasting** | Predicting stock market prices, forecasting future demand for a product, stocking inventory requirements | Continuous (a number) |

In both above cases, a supervised learning approach is often used. Meaning, you'd have some example data and a label associated with that data.

For example, in forecasting the price of Bitcoin, your data could be the historical price of Bitcoin for the past month and the label could be today's price (the label can't be tomorrow's price because that's what we'd want to predict).
